How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs is an integral part of the development lifecycle. If developers are unsure of the clients needs, they will not be able to deliver the best quality product. I interpret user needs by employing active listening skills when engaging with the client directly or by meeting with the product manager. Then, through applying sound reasoning and critical thinking I convert these needs into actionable user stories that capture the important contextual information provided by the user.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approach development as an iterative process with a testing first approach. The needs of users are constantly changing and as a developer I must be able to pivot when needed to meet those needs. I also test my code often and try to think about edge cases and other issues that could arise down the line. The agile process I hope to incorporate into my future development is the review step. Whether with peers, users, or the client I want to bring others into the development process by discussing how my work fits the specifications of the product.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member in software development means being able to work collaboratively while being a strong team member yourself. Communication, early and often is key when working in a team environment. Letting others know what you are working on and what you will be working on next is important for planning purposes. It is also important to keep our skills sharp as developers. Each team member should ensure that they are receptive to help but also willing to help others in areas where they may be strong. Additionally, I believe that all team members in software development should be life-long learners.
